1. 独自完成lecture1到4的代码
> Get the Memorize game working as demonstrated in lectures 1 through 4. Type in all the code. Do not copy/paste from anywhere.   

2. 你的游戏仍应有洗牌功能
> Your game should still shuffle the cards.   

3. 为你的游戏加入“主题”。主题包括“主题名“、一套相应的emoji和一定数量的卡组（至少有一个主题的卡牌个数是随机的）及配套的颜色（比如橙色就很适合“万圣节主题”）。
> Architect the concept of a “theme” into your game. A theme consists of a name for the theme, a set of emoji to use, a number of cards to show (which, for at least one, but not all themes, should be random), and an appropriate color to use to draw (e.g. orange would be appropriate for a Halloween theme).   

4. 为你的游戏创建至少六种主题
> Support at least 6 different themes in your game.   

5. 新的主题应只需要一行代码就能加入你的代码
> A new theme should be able to be added to your game with a single line of code.   

6. 添加一个“新游戏”功能，用来开始一局新的游戏。这个新游戏的主题应该是随机的。你可以将这个按钮随意摆放。
> Add a “New Game” button to your UI which begins a brand new game. This new game should have a randomly chosen theme. You can put this button anywhere you think looks best in your UI.   

7. 为你的游戏添加主题显示
> Show the theme’s name somewhere in your UI.   

8. 添加“分数”功能。每个成功的配对加2分；错误的配对减一分。
> Keep score in your game by giving 2 points for every match and penalizing 1 point for every previously seen card that is involved in a mismatch.   

9. 为你的游戏添加分数显示
> Display the score in your UI in whatever way you think looks best.   

10. 你的UI应支持所有的iOS设备，且不论横屏还是竖屏。我们对卡组的显示比例不作要求。这项作业可能不需要任何的实际代码（这是SwiftUI的强大之处），但请一定试试用Xcode模拟不同的设备，观看结果。
> Your UI should work in portrait or landscape on any iOS device. The cards can have any aspect ratio you’d like. This probably will not require any work on your part (that’s part of the power of SwiftUI), but be sure to continue to experiment with running on different simulators in Xcode to be sure.
